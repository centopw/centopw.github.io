# How to Contribute

I want to thank you for sparing a time to improve this project! Here are some guidelines for contributingï¼š

To ensure that the blog design is not confused, this project does not accept suggestions for design changes, such as color scheme, fonts, typography, etc. If your request is about an enhancement, it is recommended to first submit a [`Feature Request`](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy/issues/new?labels=enhancement&template=feature_request.md) issue to discuss whether your idea fits the project. 

Generally, contribute to the project by:

1. Fork this project on GitHub and clone it locally.
2. Create a new branch named `feature/my-feature` (or `feature/fix-a-bug`), which branch from `develop`:

    ```console
    $ git checkout -b feature/<my-feature> develop
    ```
    > Please note that the new branch name must include the prefix `feature/`.

3. After completing the development, commit and push to remote.
4. Submit a new **pull request** to the `develop` branch of upstream, i.e., `cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy:develop`.
